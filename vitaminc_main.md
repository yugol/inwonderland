# Vitamin C #
**Vitamin C** is a learning aid for the children (of whatever age) who want to learn programming in a "quick feedback loop" manner.

It allows the usage of all programming capabilities of the _very real and powerful_ Python programming language (via Jython), without requiring any previous knowledge, while providing an intuitive interface where the program, the quick commands and the results (graphical or not) are instantly available.

Inspired by the Logo programming language, a particular attention was paid on organizing all the Turtle instructions in a way that makes them easy to memorize and use.
