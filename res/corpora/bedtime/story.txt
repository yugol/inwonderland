Elizabeth had two cats.
Their names were Micki and Minnie.
They looked exactly alike.
Micki was a grey cat.
Minnie was a grey cat.
Micki had a white spot on her chest.
Minnie had a white spot on her chest.
Elizabeth never knew which one was in her lap.
She looked for her brother.
He was on his way outside to wash his car.
"How do you tell the cats apart?"
Elizabeth asked him.
"I think Micki's tail is a little longer," her brother said.
He went out the door.
Elizabeth took a ruler from her desk.
She measured the cats' tails.
Micki's tail was 11 inches long.
Minnie's tail was 11 inches long.
There must be some way to know which is which, Elizabeth thought.
She meowed at the cats.
They meowed back at her.
Micki had a high, soft meow.
Minnie had a high, soft meow.
She looked deep into their eyes.
Micki's eyes were green, with a little yellow.
Minnie's eyes were green, with a little yellow.
Elizabeth's mother was on her way into the bathroom to take a shower.
"How do you tell the cats apart?"
Elizabeth asked.
"I don't," her mother replied.
She closed the door.
Elizabeth sat down on the sofa with a big sigh.
She didn't know what to do.
I will never be able to tell these cats apart!, she thought.
She looked down at the cat who sat nearest her feet.
"Which one are you?" she asked.
"I'm Minnie," the cat replied.
"All you had to do was ask."
"Oh," Elizabeth blinked.
The cat jumped into her lap.
Elizabeth smiled and began to pet her.
"Hi, Minnie," she said.
